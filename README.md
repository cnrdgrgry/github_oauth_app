Codecademy Project OAuth Project for end of User Authentication and Authentication

## GitHub OAuth Application

#### Create an application that can be authenticated by your GitHub account.

Set up GitHub OAuth Application
In this off-platform project, you will be using GitHub to authenticate our web application.

### Review

Congratulations! You just created an OAuth flow that connects to a GitHub account. Restart the server and log in to the app using your GitHub account. When you are logged in, you can go to the /account page and see details from your GitHub account displayed.

In this project, we implemented OAuth using the express-session module to manage user sessions authenticated using the passport module. We configured passport using the credentials from GitHub and implemented the URL routes for authentication. Finally, we implemented a middleware function to protect the route.

Now you have the skills to implement authentication safely and securely using OAuth.
